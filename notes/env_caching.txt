Env caching:

1. on start dump environment into unordered_map
2. every read & write will read from the unordered_map
3. if we need to launch external command stringify the entire map and pass it onto the command
 -> this will even work with cmd rewrite, so if launching background job we'll still have the cache

DLL Extensions will have to use custom function that they will get a pointer to
